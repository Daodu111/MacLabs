Meeting with Sam Daodu the founder of macLabs

Sam Daodu detailed plans to refine MLabs' website content to focus on crypto and web3 brands, specifically targeting web3 gaming, gamble-fi, DeFi platforms, and crypto infrastructure tools, while defining DeFi and crypto infrastructure. Sam Daodu outlined two core services: 1. ghostwriting for crypto founders and 2. crypto marketing for pre-sale and ICO projects, aiming to transition from outsourced writing to direct client engagement to secure more substantial deals. Sam Daodu also discussed implementing a value-driven website funnel, removing explicit pricing, integrating client testimonials and a blog

Website Content and Niche Refinement Sam Daodu outlined plans to refine the website content for MLabs, emphasizing a niche focus on crypto and web3 brands, specifically targeting web3 gaming, gamble-fi, DeFi platforms, and crypto infrastructure tools, rather than generalizing to SaaS and broader tech (00:00:00). Sam Daodu clarified that this specific focus aims to avoid industries with negative associations while still operating within the broader web3 space, which is everything in crypto (00:02:10). Aisha Daodu acknowledged and understood these refinements (00:03:29) (00:05:53).
Definition of DeFi and Crypto Infrastructure Sam Daodu elaborated on DeFi (Decentralized Finance), explaining it goes beyond simple buying and selling of cryptocurrency, encompassing activities like staking, lending, and investing in blockchain-based financial instruments (00:03:29). Sam Daodu also defined crypto infrastructure tools, listing wallets, exchanges, and analytics tools like CoinMarketCap as essential for interacting with the crypto market (00:04:38).
Core Services: Ghostwriting and Crypto Marketing Sam Daodu detailed the two main services offered by MLabs: ghostwriting and crypto marketing. Sam Daodu specified that crypto marketing primarily involves writing promotional content for pre-sale projects and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), which are initial coin offerings to early investors to raise funds (00:07:04).
Ghostwriting Client Focus and Service Delivery Sam Daodu explained that ghostwriting services target crypto founders, executives, and influencers who aim to raise money, attract users, or build trust and following (00:10:42). Sam Daodu clarified that the services would involve building funnels for lead generation and enhancing social presence primarily on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn, rather than other platforms like Instagram or Facebook (00:13:13).
Transition to Direct Client Engagement Sam Daodu expressed a desire to move from being an outsourced writer for marketing agencies to directly engaging with projects, aiming to secure more substantial and direct deals (00:14:29). Sam Daodu shared past experiences where they earned significant income by writing a high volume of articles for a single client, emphasizing the potential for "crazy money" when working directly with projects (00:16:18).
Sustainability of Crypto Marketing Projects and Introduction of Ghostwriting Sam Daodu noted that while crypto marketing projects can be highly lucrative, they are not always sustainable, often pausing during market downturns (00:17:31). To address this, Sam Daodu plans to add high-ticket ghostwriting services as a more stable offering, recognizing that being hired solely as a writer often leads to fewer articles and lower pay (00:18:47).
Website Funnel and Pricing Strategy Sam Daodu discussed implementing a value-driven funnel on the website where prospective clients can receive free valuable content in exchange for their email, encouraging more sign-ups than a simple contact form (00:23:20). Sam Daodu also decided to remove explicit pricing from the website, preferring to tailor pricing based on the client's budget and specific needs after direct consultation (00:26:06).
Client Testimonials and Blog Integration Sam Daodu intends to gather authentic testimonials from past clients, including their pictures, to enhance credibility on the website (00:38:02). The "About Founder" section will be converted into a blog, where articles will be posted to showcase writing quality and provide valuable content, ensuring the website reflects the precise nature of the services offered (00:42:56).
Professional Conduct and Self-Worth in Client Interactions Sam Daodu advised Aisha Daodu on the importance of professional conduct with clients, stressing that even with personal relationships, client interactions should be treated as professional transactions where one's time and skills are valued and compensated (00:45:22). Sam Daodu emphasized the need to confidently discuss pricing and avoid working for free, asserting that payment is for skill and value, not charity or pocket money (00:46:50).
